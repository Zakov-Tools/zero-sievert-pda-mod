# ZERO Sievert MOD: PDA for advanced information

## Description

The player will now have a PDA that will allow him to consult advanced information about the items he collects during a hunt.

The PDA will display information such as:
- Selling price of each item (and of the stack).
- Selling price per kg
- Selling price per slot (and of the maximum stack)

The PDA will be able to analyze all the items and display overlays in the inventory:
- Selling price per slot of each item
- Selling price per kg of each item

## Installation

Last version: v0.28.3

1. Check that the version of your game matches the last version of the mod.
2. Download the `data.win` [here](https://github.com/Zakov-Tools/zero-sievert-pda-mod/raw/main/bin/data.7z).
3. Go to the installation folder of your game (the folder where you can find `ZERO Sievert.exe`).
4. Make a backup of the original `data.win` in case you want to play again without the mod.
5. Extract and replace the `data.win` file with the file you just downloaded.
6. Run the game.

## Future ideas

- The PDA can be obtained by completing a quest, buying it, or crafting it.
- The PDA will be obtained by installing a module in the base.
